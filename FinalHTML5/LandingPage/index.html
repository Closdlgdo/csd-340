                    Although chilling and studying sound like they would counteract themselves; they don't for me. I enjoy the time I spend learning something new. I consider that time chilling as well. My wife and I are usually in the same room as well as our pets. They tend to hover around us while we are just sitting.

                    </div>
                    Although it has been a while since I last played. The sport is still in my heart and I enjoy kicking the ball around with my wife or with friends. My love for the game is not only when the ball is at my feet but also when I watch it either live or on the televison. I've played this sport for well over 15 years and I feel like it has taught me various life lessons as well as it helped me grow as to who I am now.

                    What can I say about video games that people who have played it religiously already do not know? Yes, I am and will always be easily entertained with a fps. Call of Duty was a huge part of my early adulthood. I know that does not sound very thrilling but to me it was. It was a scapegoat from real life at the time when things were not going the best for me. It was a way to vent, a way to relieve stress when I was not able to take it out on sports.

                    Arizona Furnishings was actually my first employer when I turned 17. My dad started working there first and he was the one who was able to give me my first summer job. I have never worked so hard in my life before that. I have been off and on in that job, however, a little less than 5 years ago I went full time with them. It felt like the right decision. This is my current employer and I am eternally grateful for what my boss has done for me. I have recently obtained the role of Lead Installer and now drive my own box truck. I get to install commercial furniture to schools, government offices and regular offices as well. It keeps me moving and is a great workout.

                    </div>
                    Mercedes Benz was a great job! It taught me many valuable life lessons. When I first started there, I began working as a car wash attendant. I was the one who washed peoples' cars after they got a service done. After a few years in that position, they promoted me to valet/choffer. I was able to take the customers who needed a ride home while their car was getting serviced. I received numerous accolades from customers, that the GM started to take notice of how great I was with people. During that time, Mercedes Benz of America was beginning a new position for all of their dealerships. This was the 'product concierge' position. Due to my great understanding of people, the GM made me the first ever for that dealership to be a product concierge. In this role, I was the one who would teach the customer about their new or old vehicle. If they had issues with connecting their devices or learning how all the buttons worked in their car, I was the guy. That was probably one of my favorite jobs I have ever had. I was able to drive to customers and make appointments and it was quite rewarding knowing I was helping many people in my own way.

                        BestBuy
                    </div>
                        BestBuy was my only job where it made me have to constantly interact with people to sell them things. Although we did not work off commission, the manager as well as corporate sure did make it feel that way. Obviously meeting numbers was a weekly deal so that only made the job itself stressful. They did have great employee discounts and they had a lot of training available if I wanted to switch to another role. I was the Media Specialist. Basically, I helped you with videogames, movies, and portable systems. The thing with that was that I was barely in my own section because I always got pulled away to other areas like TVs, Appliances, Computers and Cameras. It helped that I was bilingual and spoke Spanish fluently. I was able to help people in various departments and learn a lot from my coworkers.
